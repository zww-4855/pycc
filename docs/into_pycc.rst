Introduction to pycc
====================

The motivation behind the pycc software is to fill the void creating by hyper-performance focused electronic structure software platforms. It has been my experience that most modern computational chemistry codes are not suitable for rapid development and testing of novel electronic structure methods. The presents quite a dilemma, as the theoretical chemist must contend with both theory development AND implementation of new ideas into software meaning there are at least two possible bottlenecks he/she must reconcile with before progress is made. 

pycc was conceived as an acceptable middle-ground, wherein suitable, low-rank approaches based on coupled cluster (CC) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) can be seemlessly integrated into the pycc workflow and rapidly explored.
